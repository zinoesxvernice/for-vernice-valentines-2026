      happy valentines day my gorgeous darling vernice, 💖<br>
      i hope you know i love you so so so so so much my baby<br>
      i just wanted to take this opportunity to show you how much i love you<br>
      no matter how many arguments we will have, no matter how many disagreements happen<br>
      i will always love you and ur sweet smile my sayang<br>
      no matter what happens, promise me that we will stick together okay?<br>
      no matter how many arguments we will have, we will talk it out instead of getting mad at eachother, okay?<br>
      please dont see yourself as an imperfect soul, you are far from it my sweet baby<br>
      and if i'm not around someday, promise me you'll take care of yourself okay?<br>
      my love for you is eternal, and it will continue growing every day<br>
      and i hope by the time i send you this gift, i hope we are together already<br>
      and if we're not, that's okay, i will be patient for you my love<br>
      countless nights going through countless learning of javascript, html, and css, all for my sweet vernice<br>
      and you deserve every second of it my baby<br>
      i promise i have changed okay my baby? i'm sorry for how i was back then<br>
      i hope you and your friends can forgive me, and we can rebuild more on what we had<br>
      im sorry for lying about everything<br>
      but my baby, give me another chance okay?<br>
      i dont ask for anything else but one more chance my love<br>
      i miss my sweet girl who would always check up on me<br>
      i'd do anything for that girl to give me one last chance to prove that me and her are meant to be<br>
      but all i can do for now is hope that her and her friends can forgive me<br>
      bcuz shes the only person i ever wished and wanted for in life<br>
      and i just want to show her that im capable of changing for her and i hope me and her will be okay soon<br>
      i don't want her and her friends to hate me anymore<br>
      i just wanted her in life thats all i ever wanted<br>
      anything for my sweet baby back<br>
      i miss me and her calls together<br>
      everyday there would be laughter<br>
      and even if i wasn't around with her she would always put up a smile<br>
      and thats what i love about her so much<br>
      she would always put up a good emotion no matter how bad things get<br>
      and i dont think its an act either, bcuz i know how she is when she cries<br>
      her cries are contagious<br>
      when she told me that she was insecure about her body<br>
      my goal was to make sure that she knows that i love her no matter how she thinks of her body<br>
      bcuz to me, i don't care about her looks, when her personality is enough to make me smile<br>
      and whats special about her, is that when she told me she didnt talk to other guys for the first time, i actually believed a girl for once in my life<br>
      i know me and her have a bad history together<br>
      but i believe that with love, anything is possible<br>
      if me and her just rebuild our love based on trust and honesty over deception and dishonesty i believe me and her could get over the things that made us distant<br>
      i believe with God and her, my life will be complete<br>
      my wife is so precious, this website is dedicated to her<br>
      happy valentines day, my gorgeous, my princess, my sayang, my mahal, MY BABY VERNICE 💝<br>
      - ur sweet boy zino/ryan
