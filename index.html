    <div class="event" data-date="Dec 22, 2024" data-desc="on this day, we met eachother, and to be honest, i was planning to 
        quit discord here but im glad that i met you, and i stuck around just for a bit
        longer, my love i will never forget this day, no matter how many arguments we
        have, you are genuinely the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most beautiful, most
        gorgeous, and smartest girl ive ever met, and im so so so so so so so so so glad
        for God putting us in our paths together, if i hadn't met you, i wouldn't have a
        reason to change for a girl and i would probably still be a horrible person in some
        alternate universe, you know why? because you were the motivation for me to get up
        and improve my life, you gave me a reason to change and im so so grateful for you
        if i hadnt't stuck around, who knows what might've happened, and thats  probably
        the only thing i can thank ezra for by convincing me to stick around just a bit
        more, and it's pretty crazy to think that huh, us meeting completely depended on
        a decision from ezra to tell me to stick around, i'm not much of a believer in fate
        or divine intervention but i don't really know what else to call it my sweet darling,
        baby, i promise i have changed alot and i have matured, i know that we had a shitty past
        but, i want to forget about it and instead rebuild our relationship, but this time without
        the awkward talking stage, we atleast know our strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes,
        so that the next time you give me a chance, i will be able to focus on our relationship
        i promise that i won't have wandering eyes and that i wont talk to any other girl
        i promise my sweet girl.">

    <div class="event" data-date="Dec 30, 2024" data-desc="im so excited to talk about this date, its our anniversary of course,
      my baby? you know im forever grateful for this day, we were the happiest couple ever and everyone was so jealous of us,
      i loved it so so so so so so much my baby, every 30th of the month, or the 2nd or 3rd of february, we get to celebrate
      our love together, and im so glad that we are capable of doing that, my love, my baby, my princess, my sayang, despite
      all the things we have done to eachother, i will forgive you and i hope you can too, i promise my baby once you give me
      that one last chance, i will forgive you and i won't be mad, im sorry for everytime i got mad at you at the past my sweet
      girl, im sorry for always blaming you and always pinning our problems on you when instead i should have looked at the bigger
      picture and realize that it was all my fault, i should have fixed the problem with you, not blame you for it, it should be us
      against the problem, not me against u against the problem, i've come to realized that and i promise that i will communicate more
      moving forward, instead of being mad all the time and pinning things on u, i will communicate about my problems and my worries to you
      then we will fix things together, like how real love should be. im so glad for our anniversary my baby, and i hope that more monthsaries,
      anniversaries, decades, and more to come my love, i promise we will be fixing things if you give me one more chance okay baby, we will forgive
      and fix things instead of pinning it on you like how i used to, i love you so much my sayang, i promise that i have grown and matured and that
      i will actively communicate and that i wont call you slurs, and i wont swear at you, and i wont cuss at you my baby, im sorry for all the slurs
      i hsve ever called you and i promise i will communicate and fix things instead of getting angry and being abusive and being horrible to you, i love
      you my sweet girl.">

      happy valentines day my gorgeous darling vernice, 💖<br>
      i hope you know i love you so so so so so much my baby<br>
      i just wanted to take this opportunity to show you how much i love you<br>
      no matter how many arguments we will have, no matter how many disagreements happen<br>
      i will always love you and ur sweet smile my sayang<br>
      no matter what happens, promise me that we will stick together okay?<br>
      no matter how many arguments we will have, we will talk it out instead of getting mad at eachother, okay?<br>
      please dont see yourself as an imperfect soul, you are far from it my sweet baby<br>
      and if i'm not around someday, promise me you'll take care of yourself okay?<br>
      my love for you is eternal, and it will continue growing every day<br>
      and i hope by the time i send you this gift, i hope we are together already<br>
      and if we're not, that's okay, i will be patient for you my love<br>
      countless nights going through countless learning of javascript, html, and css, all for my sweet vernice<br>
      and you deserve every second of it my baby<br>
      i promise i have changed okay my baby? i'm sorry for how i was back then<br>
      i hope you and your friends can forgive me, and we can rebuild more on what we had<br>
      im sorry for lying about everything<br>
      but my baby, give me another chance okay?<br>
      i dont ask for anything else but one more chance my love<br>
      i miss my sweet girl who would always check up on me<br>
      i'd do anything for that girl to give me one last chance to prove that me and her are meant to be<br>
      but all i can do for now is hope that her and her friends can forgive me<br>
      bcuz shes the only person i ever wished and wanted for in life<br>
      and i just want to show her that im capable of changing for her and i hope me and her will be okay soon<br>
      i don't want her and her friends to hate me anymore<br>
      i just wanted her in life thats all i ever wanted<br>
      anything for my sweet baby back<br>
      i miss me and her calls together<br>
      everyday there would be laughter<br>
      and even if i wasn't around with her she would always put up a smile<br>
      and thats what i love about her so much<br>
      she would always put up a good emotion no matter how bad things get<br>
      and i dont think its an act either, bcuz i know how she is when she cries<br>
      her cries are contagious<br>
      when she told me that she was insecure about her body<br>
      my goal was to make sure that she knows that i love her no matter how she thinks of her body<br>
      bcuz to me, i don't care about her looks, when her personality is enough to make me smile<br>
      and whats special about her, is that when she told me she didnt talk to other guys for the first time, i actually believed a girl for once in my life<br>
      i know me and her have a bad history together<br>
      but i believe that with love, anything is possible<br>
      if me and her just rebuild our love based on trust and honesty over deception and dishonesty i believe me and her could get over the things that made us distant<br>
      i believe with God and her, my life will be complete<br>
      my wife is so precious, this website is dedicated to her<br>
      happy valentines day, my gorgeous, my princess, my sayang, my mahal, MY BABY VERNICE 💝<br>
      - ur sweet boy zino/ryan
