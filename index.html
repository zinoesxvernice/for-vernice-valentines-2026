    <div class="event" data-date="dec 30, 2024" data-desc="on this day, 411 days ago, at 4:53 PM, i dmed u on discord because elise told me so and im glad i did, my best decision of my life was getting together with you, you helped me overcome my challenges and assisted me in my problems in life, my first text to you was, 'hey kitten' and now that i think about it, it was pretty corny that i did that, i wish i couldve done a more better introduction of myself but i cant change the past now, this day will always hold a very special place in my heart, as this day was of course the day we got together, i know at first you didnt expect us to last as long but i also expected us to break up in 1 week, but i guess not so after i started dating you i stayed on discord just a bit longer however i was still planning to leave, but of course you changed my mind as ive stated before, you were still the sweetest princess i knew around this time and you still are up to this day, i'll forever remember this day no matter how many arguments we have or if we're even still together as of writing this, i love you so much vernice, after this we got to spend our first new year together however i'll let the next timeline explain that">
